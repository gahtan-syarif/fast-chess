NAME
       fast-chess - a command-line tool for managing chess games with engines

SYNOPSIS
       fast-chess [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION 
        Fast-chess is a command-line tool designed to manage and orchestrate chess games between engines.
        It provides a range of options to configure game settings,
        engine parameters, concurrency, and output formats.

OPTIONS
        The following options are available:

        -quick cmd=ENGINE1 cmd=ENGINE2 book=BOOK
            Shortcut for predefined game settings involving two engines, time controls,
            rounds, and concurrency.

        -event NAME
            Set the event name for the PGN header.

        -site NAME
            Set the site name for the PGN header.

        -config file=NAME [discard=(true|false)]
            Save or load engine configurations to resume games from previous sessions.
            Use 'discard=true' to discard saved game results.

        -concurrency N
            Set the concurrency level to N. Default value is 1.

        -rounds N
            Play N rounds of games. Default value is 2.

        -games N
            Play N games in each round. Default value is 2. 
            This should be set to 1 or 2, setting this higher than 2 does not provide meaningful results.

        -variant VARIANT
            fischerandom - play Fischer Random Chess

        -repeat
            Sets the number of games to 2. This is equivalent to -games 2.

        -recover
            Recover from a crash. This will attempt to recover the engine after a crash, to continue with 
            the tournament.

        -draw movenumber=NUMBER movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
            Set conditions for a draw based on the number of moves, move count, and score threshold.
              
                NUMBER - the number of moves before checking for a draw. Default value is 0.
                COUNT  - the number of moves below the score threshold to adjudicate a draw. Default value is 1.
                SCORE  - the score threshold (in centipawns) for a draw.

        -resign movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
            Configure when the engine should resign based on move count and score threshold.

                COUNT - the number of moves to make before resigning. Default value is 1.
                SCORE - the score threshold (in centipawns) to resign at.

        -openings file=NAME format=(epd|pgn) [order=ORDER] [plies=PLIES] [start=START]
            Specify an opening book file and its format for game starting positions.

                format - the file format, either epd or pgn.
                ORDER  - the order of moves to be played, either random or sequential. Default is random.
                PLIES  - the number of plies to use.
                START  - the starting offset.

        -output format=FORMAT
            Choose the output format for game results (cutechess or fastchess). Default is fastchess.

        -pgnout notation=(san|lan|uci) file=FILE [nodes=(true|false)] [seldepth=(true|false)] [nps=(true|false)]
            Export games in PGN format with specified notations and optional tracking of nodes, seldepth, and nps.

                notation
                    san - Standard Algebraic Notation
                    lan - Long Algebraic Notation
                    uci - Universal Chess Interface

                FILE - filename.
                nodes - defaults to false, track node count.
                seldepth - defaults to false, track seldepth.
                nps - defaults to false, track nps.

        -ratinginterval N
            Set the rating interval for the rating report. For penta reports, this is reports per N game pair.

        -sprt elo0=ELO0 elo1=ELO1 alpha=ALPHA beta=BETA model=MODEL
            Set parameters for the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).
            For more information see https://tests.stockfishchess.org/sprt_calc?elo-model=Normalized&elo-0=0&elo-1=2&draw-ratio=0.49&rms-bias=191

            -model=MODEL
                Specify the model to use.

                Specify the engine command.

            name=NAME
                Set the engine name. Must be unique.

            [args="ARGS"]
                If you want to pass multiple arguments, use args="ARG1 ARG2 ARG3".
                Please note that double quotes inside the string must be escaped, 
                e.g., args="single words \"multiple words\"" -> your engine will receive

                single
                words
                multiple words

            [tc=TC] 
                TC uses the same format as Cute-Chess. For example,
                10+0.1 would be 10 seconds with 100 millisecond increments.
            
            [st=ST]
                Movetime for the engine in seconds.
            
            [nodes=NODES]
                Maximum number of nodes to search. If supported.
            
            [plies=PLIES]
                Plies (depth) to search. If supported.
            
            [depth=DEPTH]
                Depth to search. If supported. Does the same as plies.
            
            [dir=DIR]
                Working directory for the engine.

            [option.name=VALUE]
                This can be used to set engine options. Note that the engine must support the option.
                For example, to set the hash size to 128MB, use option.Hash=128.


EXAMPLES
        To start a game between two engines using specific configurations:
            $ fast-chess -engine cmd=Engine1.exe name=Engine1 -engine cmd=Engine2.exe \
              name=Engine2 -each tc=10+0.1 -rounds 200 -repeat -concurrency 4

        To resume a game from a saved configuration:
            $ fast-chess -config file=saved_game.conf
